# The sycspector scans a file for patterns provided on the command line.
# Lines that match the pattern are saved to a valid file and those lines that
# don't match the pattern are added to an invalid file.
# The valid and invalid files as well as the used pattern are stored in a
# history file. The saved values are used for a subsequent call to sycspector
# with --show and -f for fix.
#
# Invokation Examples
#   sycspector mail_addresses -p email
# searches for email addresses in the provided file 'email_addresses'
#
# Lines that are not recognized can be prompted, fixed and appended to the
# valid file with
#   sycspector -fa
#
# To show the result of the invokation use
#   sycspector --show
